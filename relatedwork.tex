Interfaces exhibit a local spatial correlation in that a residue is more likely to be a part of an interface if nearby residues are also a part of the interface. 
Local spatial correlation can aid prediction if information from nearby residues is taken into account during prediction.


Such methods exist, but are often based on energy minimization techniques which are computationally expensive and attempt to model the entire 3D structure of the interface at once~\cite{esmaielbeiki2015}.
Some of these methods (Haddock~\cite{zundert2016} for example) allow the user to suggest amino acid residues which are likely part of the interface, to help bias the algorithm towards a correct solution.
This has motivated work to predict amino acid pairs which constitute part of the interface without solving for the entire interface at once.
