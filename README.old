## The Official Colorado State University Thesis/Dissertation LaTeX Template

Welcome to [the repository for the official LaTeX template for Colorado State University theses and dissertations](https://github.com/idfah/csuthesis).  This package is designed to help users of the LaTeX typesetting system get started writing their thesis.  Please also review [the official guidelines and sample pages provided by the CSU graduate school](http://graduateschool.colostate.edu/for-current-students/completing-your-degree/thesis-dissertation/), which provide important information about the style and formatting of your document.

*If you plan on using another typesetting or word processing system for your thesis, e.g., MS Word or LibreOffice, then this package will likely not be helpful for you*.

## Getting Started

__To get started, please review the sample.pdf and sample.tex files included with this package__.  These files will serve both as the documentation for this template and also as a starting point for your thesis.  Most users will probably want to copy *sample.tex* to something like *thesis.tex* and begin inserting their own content using the provided examples.

## Support

The final chapter of *sample.pdf* contains solutions to problems that are commonly encountered when creating a CSU thesis in LaTeX.  Please look this section first when trying to troubleshoot a problem.  If this section does not address your problem and you later discover a solution, please submit a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/idfah/csuthesis) that includes a description of your problem and solution.  This will help others who encounter the same problem in the future.

The CSU graduate school and Morgan Library are unable to provide troubleshooting support for LaTeX users at this time, other than reviewing your final pdf document.  You may want to locate other LaTeX users in your department or college.  [Google](http://www.google.com) and [LaTeX Stack Exchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/) are also excellent resources for LaTeX troubleshooting.

If you run into any bugs, shortcomings or other problems with this package, please feel free to submit a bug report on [GitHub](https://github.com/idfah/csuthesis).  If you are able to provide a fix yourself, pull requests are very much appreciated.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank [the CSU Graduate Student Council](https://sites.google.com/a/rams.colostate.edu/gsc/) and [the CSU Graduate School](http://graduateschool.colostate.edu/) for initiating, commissioning and supporting this project.  I would also like to thank Nicole Ramo for her support and ensuring that we followed through with this project to completion.  I would like to thank Leif Anderson, who created and supported the previous LaTeX template for a number of years.  Although I have never met Leif, his work was invaluable in the creation of this package and has helped many students get their thesis approved by the CSU graduate school.  Finally, I would like to thank everyone who helps to contribute to this package.  Your work will help many CSU graduate students to create professional, beautiful and compelling theses and dissertations using LaTex.  Last but not least, thank you to the creators and maintaners of LaTeX for creating a fantastic typesetting tool.
